# PE+ICL Semi-supervised Learning Project

## Current Issues
The current implementation faces two main challenges:
- Training data (Swiss Roll) is too simplistic
- Semi-supervised learning performance is unstable

## Task List
### Completed
- âœ“ Corrected PE+ICL architecture logic for semi-supervised learning

### In Progress
- Model Robustness Testing
  - Train: Swiss Roll dataset
  - Test: Swiss Roll with Gaussian noise
- Dataset Enhancement
  - Identify more challenging datasets
  - Implement complex data structures

## Next Steps
Focus on implementing more sophisticated datasets to improve model training stability.
